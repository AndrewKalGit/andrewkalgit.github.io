                    <p>Thank you for always being my rock and walking with me through life's adventures.
                    I am so grateful to have you in my life and you remind me everyday to cherish it.
                    Without you I would be without my other half. You don't only complete me but you 
                    make me a better man. You remind me that I am never truly alone. That I always have 
                    someone in my corner.</p>

                    have enough strength to get up myself, you don't just start my day you energize it.
                    When I am sick and don't feel like I can make it through the day, you reassure me 
                    and make me feel well again.</p>

                    <p>I will never forget the times we spent at greenway and just laughed so hard you had to 
                    massage your cheeks because they hurt so much from laughing. Or the hardships we faced
                    at nights in treetops. Yes I cherish it all the good and hard times because it made us.
